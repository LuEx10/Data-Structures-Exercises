# Data Structures Exercises

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures** exercises I implemented in **C++** for my data structures class.

## Overview

This repository is aimed at students and developers who want to deepen their understanding of **Data Structures** using C++. It includes exercises for implementing common data structures from scratch and practicing problem-solving using them. Each data structure has its own set of tasks, explanations, and code solutions.

## Data Structures Covered

The repository covers the following data structures:

- **Arrays**
- **Structs**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Graphs**
- **Bitsets**
- **Heaps**
- **Trees**

## Technologies

- **C++**: All data structures and algorithms are implemented using **C++**.
- **Graphviz**: In order to visualize the graphs, they are printed out in a format compatible with [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)
